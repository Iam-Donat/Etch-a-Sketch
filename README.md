# Etch-a-Sketch (The ODIN Project)

## Project Description 📃:

This is a An Etch-a-Sketch built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and i made it as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch" >The Odin Project</a> Foundation Course.

Main takeaways from this project are that it helped solidify my understanding of the DOM Manipilation process.
